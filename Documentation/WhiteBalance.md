## White Balance in Lumina

Lumina includes White Balance adjustments to fine-tune the color temperature and tint of your game’s visuals. This effect leverages Unity’s Volume framework for precise control.

### How to Use White Balance

To apply and configure White Balance in Lumina, follow these steps:

1. **Open White Balance Tab**:
   - Click the Lumina button located at the bottom right of the interface to open the White Balance tab.

2. **Enable White Balance**:
   - Ensure the White Balance effect is activated by checking 2 appropriate checkboxes in the Lumina UI.

3. **Configure White Balance Settings**:
   - Adjust the properties to achieve your desired visual effect.

### Properties

- **Temperature**: Adjust the white balance to a custom color temperature using this slider. Higher values result in a warmer color temperature, while lower values make it cooler. This allows for fine-tuning the overall warmth or coolness of your scene.

- **Tint**: Use the slider to compensate for a green or magenta tint, helping to correct any unwanted color shifts in your scene.
