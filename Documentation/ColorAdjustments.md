## Color Adjustments

For detailed information on Color Adjustments in Unity HDRP, refer to the [Unity HDRP Color Adjustments documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@13.1/manual/Post-Processing-Color-Adjustments.html).

Lumina incorporates a range of color adjustment tools from Unity HDRP to fine-tune the overall tone, brightness, and contrast of your game’s visuals. These adjustments are applied through Unity’s Volume framework, allowing for precise control over your scene’s appearance.

### How to Use Color Adjustments

To apply Color Adjustments in your Unity HDRP project with Lumina, follow these steps:

1. **Open Color Adjustments Tab**:
   - Click the Lumina button located at the bottom right of the interface to open the Color Adjustments tab.

2. **Enable Checkboxes**:
   - Enable each checkbox for the desired effect you wish to apply.

3. **Adjust Color Settings**:
   - Use the slider next to each enabled checkbox to modify the properties. Adjust these settings to achieve the desired visual effect.

### Properties

- **Post Exposure**: Adjusts the overall exposure of the scene. This setting is applied after HDR effects and before tonemapping, so it doesn’t affect earlier effects in the post-processing chain. Use this to brighten or darken your scene.

- **Contrast**: Modify the range of tonal values in your scene using this slider. Increasing the contrast expands the tonal range, making bright areas brighter and dark areas darker, while decreasing it compresses the range for a more uniform look.

- **Color Filter**: Use the color picker to apply a color filter to your scene. This color multiplies the rendered image and tints the result, affecting the overall color tone.

- **Hue Shift**: Shift the hue of all colors in your scene with this slider. This lets you alter the color tones across the entire image, creating different color moods or correcting color imbalances.

- **Saturation**: Adjust the intensity of all colors in your scene using this slider. Increasing saturation makes colors more vivid, while decreasing it results in a more muted or grayscale appearance.

By following these steps and understanding these properties, you can effectively use Lumina’s Color Adjustments to enhance the visual quality of your *Cities Skylines II*  experience.
