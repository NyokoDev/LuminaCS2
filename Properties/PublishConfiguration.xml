		Lumina (formerly ColorAdjustments).
		Unlike PPM (Preserve Photo Mode). This mod allows you to save color settings so you don't have to redo them next time you open the game. This mod is planned to have all the values from Photo Mode, but that's still pending.


This mod is in Beta. More features coming (I don't have the time I had hoped right now).

		Installation and Usage
		Automatic installation (Restart the game if required)



		1. Settings Menu: You can switch the values in the settings menu
		2. In-game UI: There's an in-game button and UI that can be activated by clicking the button or using hotkey ALT-C to toggle panel visibility.
		Then, in the panel, you can change the same values as you would in the settings menu. In settings you can also find two buttons, one for support and one to open the XML configuration file if you prefer to edit the values manually.
