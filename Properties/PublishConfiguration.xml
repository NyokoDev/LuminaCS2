	<LongDescription>
		Lumina, formerly known as ColorAdjustments, is a post-processing mod for Cities: Skylines, crafted to significantly enhance in-game visuals. It allows players to save and load color settings, eliminating the need to reconfigure them each time the game is launched.
		
		Currently in Beta, Lumina features:
		Cubemap replacement
		A time-of-day slider
		LUT selection
		Detailed color adjustments such as exposure, contrast, hue, and white balance
		Planetary settings and brightness control
		Compatibility with the game editor
		
		As one of the most complex mods I've ever designed and coded, Lumina's detailed overview of features and updates can be found on the project's GitHub repository.
		📘 Documentation: https://skylinx.gitbook.io/lumina

	<ChangeLog Value="Lumina v2.2R3 introduces support for log file zipping to aid troubleshooting, improves the LUT file dialog and adds a fully localized “Enable Lumina Volume” toggle in settings. The update enhances translations across multiple languages and reduces unnecessary error logging by switching some errors to info logs. Several problematic SCSS properties were removed to fix UI issues, and logging was minimized to prevent lag. A second attempt was made to fix UI flickering on 4K+ monitors, with ongoing monitoring planned. Documentation was updated, including a new Getting Started page and improved LUTs guide on GitBook. MetroFramework integration was abandoned due to unresolved bugs impacting simulation and window behavior." />
