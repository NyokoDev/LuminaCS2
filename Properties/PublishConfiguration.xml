		# Lumina

		Lumina, formerly known as **ColorAdjustments**, is a post-processing mod for *Cities: Skylines*, crafted to significantly enhance in-game visuals. It allows players to save and load color settings, eliminating the need to reconfigure them each time the game is launched.

		## Beta Features

		Currently in Beta, Lumina features:

		- Road wear textures replacement
		- Road color adjustment
		- Cubemap replacement
		- A time-of-day slider
		- LUT selection
		- Detailed color adjustments such as exposure, contrast, hue, and white balance
		- Planetary settings and brightness control
		- Compatibility with the game editor

		As one of the most complex mods I've ever designed and coded, Lumina's detailed overview of features and updates can be found on the project's GitHub repository.
