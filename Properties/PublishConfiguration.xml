	<LongDescription>
		Lumina, formerly known as ColorAdjustments, is a post-processing mod for Cities Skylines, crafted to significantly enhance in-game visuals. It allows players to save and load color settings, eliminating the need to reconfigure them each time the game is launched. Currently in Beta, Lumina features cubemap replacement, a time-of-day slider, LUT selection, and detailed color adjustments such as exposure, contrast, hue, and white balance. It also offers planetary settings and brightness control, and is compatible with the game editor. As one of the most complex mods I've ever designed and coded, Lumina's detailed overview of features and updates can be found on the project's GitHub repository.
