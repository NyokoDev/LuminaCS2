	<LongDescription>
		Lumina (formerly ColorAdjustments)
		Lumina from CS1 has been transferred over!

		This mod aims to be the all-in-one post-processing solution.

		Unlike PPM (Preserve Photo Mode), this mod allows you to save color settings so you don't have to redo them every time you open the game.

		This mod is planned to incorporate all the values from Photo Mode, but that's still pending.

		This mod is currently in Beta. More features are coming, although I don't have as much time as I had hoped right now.

		Features available:
		Color Adjustments:

		- Post-Exposure Adjustment: Fine-tune the post-exposure of your game visuals to achieve the perfect brightness level.

		- Contrast Control: Adjust the contrast of your game environment for enhanced visual clarity or artistic effect.

		- Hue Shift: Modify the hue of your game scenes to create unique atmospheres or match specific aesthetics.

		- Saturation Modification: Tailor the saturation of colors in your game to evoke different moods or enhance realism.

		White Balance:
		- White Balance Adjustment:*Fine-tune the white balance of your game to ensure accurate color representation.

		- Temperature and Tint Control: Adjust temperature and tint settings to influence the overall color balance of your game.

		Planetary Settings:
		- Longitude and Latitude Control: Customize longitude and latitude parameters for precise control over planetary visuals.

		Brightness:
		Shadows: Adjust the overall intensity of the shadows.

		Midtones: Midtones represent the luminance values in between. Adjust this to your liking!

		Highlights: Adjust highlights to your liking.

		Incompatibilities:
		Preserve Photo Mode: Lumina has half the same functionality.

		Sunglasses: Sunglasses makes its own volume and might conflict with Lat/Long settings within Lumina.

		New in 1.3.5:
		- To add to the above, you can use Lumina's Send to Lumina button in photo mode to send your current values to Lumina interface so you can save them or use them as you wish. (Only ColorAdjustments at this time.)

		Installation and Usage
		Automatic installation (Restart the game if required)

		Editor Compatibility:
		Works in the editor, but only with Legacy Panel, use ALT-C to bring it up.

		1. In-game UI: There's an in-game button and UI that can be activated by clicking the button Then, in the panel, you can change the values. In settings, you can also find two buttons, one for support and one to open the XML configuration file if you prefer to edit the values manually.

		Credits:
		- Quboid and Move it for code related to the icon.

		- Yenyang for input.

		- TritonSupreme for code related to the sliders.

		- DanielNotFound22 for testing and advice.

		- T.D.W for input and help.

		Translations for this mod are available in several languages including German (Germany), English (United States), Spanish by elgendo87, French (France), Italian (Italy), Japanese (Japan), Korean (South Korea), Dutch (Netherlands), Polish (Poland), Portuguese (Brazil), Romanian (Romania), Russian (Russia), Chinese (Simplified), and Chinese (Traditional).

		Information and Limitations
		- Consult Lumina's GitHub for up-to-date information and guides.

		The preset or saved settings location file is located \AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\Lumina
		You can access the above file by clicking 'Open Saved Settings File' in settings menu.

		- Lumina's send to Lumina feature only sends ColorAdjustments as of now.

		Enjoy!
